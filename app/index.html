                    <h3>Continued Learning</h3>
                    <h2>Being a UX professional requires constant learning and discovery</h2>
                    <p class="left">
                        Information in the field is ever changing and evolving, and as UX professionals, we must evolve with it, staying up to date on industry news and trends.For this reason, enrollment in Netcraft Academy includes much more than the 16-week course; it means joining our family. We help our alumni continue their UX education well after the end of the course with special alumni events, networking opportunities, and personal guidance and support.
                        <br>
                        New Courses- Part of our responsibility as UX educators is anticipating future subjects and skills that will be relevant for industry professionals.Several months ago, for example, we noticed that a growing number of job postings for visual designers asked for knowledge in HTML and CSS. As a result, we designed a pilot program teaching code to designers and UX specialists. The demand quickly grew, and we are now opening the third session for this course. Other courses that opened this year based on recognized needs include “Building an Effective Portfolio" and “Visual Design 101 for UI Specialists".
                        <br>
                        Workshops and Alumni Events- With the evolution of the industry, we regularly update our course material and add new subjects to the syllabus. We host frequent events for our alumni community that include lectures on the newest topics added to the course. Additionally, we offer these topics as workshops to the broader community. Examples of workshops include Project Pricing, Legal Practices in Design, Lean UX, and Axure Tutorials.
                        <br>
                        Personal Guidance and Support- Our students are our top priority, and it is a goal of ours at Netcraft Academy to devote individual attention to each student. We are in frequent contact with both our students and alumni, creating an “open door” environment in which they feel welcome to call to consult on personal projects, receive professional advice and career guidance, or just come soak up inspiration at our offices. Students and alumni communicate daily with our team of UX experts, including Netcraft’s CEO himself.
                        <br>
                        Facebook Groups- Each course at Netcraft Academy has a designated Facebook group for interacting with the other students and instructors. Afterwards, all alumni become part of a larger Netcraft Academy group which operates as a platform for sharing interesting articles, posting job openings, publicizing our events and sharing advice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="right">
                        Our community-wide events – Ux on Beer and Digital Design – have separate Facebook groups in which we share interesting articles, inspiring websites, helpful tools and event updates.
                        <br>
                        Netcraft Blog- As mentioned earlier, our blog serves as a great tool for keeping our community informed. The Netcraft Blog has been active since 2006 and is updated monthly with new findings, recommendations on books and UX tools, and event summaries including all presentations. We also give our students and alumni the opportunity to write a post with our guidance and get published on our blog.
                        <br>
                        because the UX industry is dynamic and in constant change we keep it our business to keep our alumni updated. That's why we conduct a yearly conference for our past student in which we give lectures about updates in the field. The other group of conferences is: Digital Design, UX on BEER and Dev Shot.
                        <br>
                        As mentioned above, our UX on Beer and Digital Design conferences – unique in their style – enable valuable and inspiring learning to our community. We invite the leading designers and UX professionals to share their knowledge and experience with the audience.
                        <br>
                        In our constant effort to promote our alumni, at each conference we offer special opportunities for our alumni to participate as one of the speakers. We give them advice, guidance, and support to produce a winning lecture.
                        <br>
                        Digital Play is our yearly national conference for graphic designers – a full day of inspiring lectures, networking opportunities, and fun surprises. At the last conference, we held a competition between three teams of three industry-leading UX designers. Running simultaneously to the lectures, the three teams were given six hours to design and produce a prototype for a fictional product chosen by the audience – in this case, an anger management application.
                        <br>
                        Conference participants could visit the team stations throughout the day to watch them work. At the end of the conference, the audience voted in real-time on the winning application. It was great fun and a wonderful way to experience the professional work process – live!

                        In line with our vision, Netcraft makes it a priority to give back to the community. Netcraft provides complimentary consultation to Box of Deams, a non-profit organization that makes less fortunate children’s dreams a reality. We are currently working on a new app for the organization.
                        <br>
                        Netcraft’s contribution helped promote Box of Dreams, which has now fulfilled more than 100 dreams.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, in our constant effort to promote innovation and UX initiatives, we offer complimentary lectures and workshops to groups of startups and entrepreneurs.
