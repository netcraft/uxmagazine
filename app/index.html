                        When NetcraftAcademy was first founded, we envisioned our target audience to be UI designers. We soon recognized an interest from other audiences, such as graphic designers, freelance professionals, project managers, marketing directors, content writers, entrepreneurs, develop team managers,  and C-Level managers.
                        <br>
                        Since our students come from diverse industries and professions we keep a high professional standard in every lesson.

                        <br>
                        In addition, we have a strict admission requirements like college degrees and appropriate professional experience in order to prevent different levels of understanding in the classroom and unqualified candidates.

                    <h3>Continued Learning</h3>
                    <h2>Being a UX Professional Requires Constant Learning and Discovery</h2>
                    <p class="left">
                        Information in the field is ever-changing and evolving, and as UX professionals, we must evolve with it, staying up to date on industry news and trends.  For this reason, enrollment in NetcraftAcademy includes much more than the 16-week course; it means joining our family. We help our alumni continue their UX education well after the end of the course with special alumni events, networking opportunities, and personal guidance and support.
                        <br>
                        Part of our responsibility as UX educators is anticipating future subjects and skills that will be relevant for industry professionals.  Several months ago, for example, we noticed that a growing number of job postings for visual designers asked for knowledge in HTML and CSS. As a result, we designed a pilot program teaching code to designers and UX specialists. The demand quickly grew, and we are now opening the third cycle of this course.
                        <br>
                        With the evolution of the industry, we regularly update our course material and add new subjects to the syllabus. We host frequent events for our alumni community that include lectures on the newest topics added to the course.
                    </p>
                    <p class="right">
                        Additionally, we offer these topics as workshops to the broader community. Examples of workshops include Project Pricing, Legal Practices in Design, Lean UX, and Axure Tutorials.
                        <br>
                        Our students are our top priority, and it is a goal of ours at Netcraft Academy to devote individual attention to each student. We are in frequent contact with both our students and alumni, creating an “open door” environment in which they feel welcome to call to consult on personal projects, receive professional advice and career guidance, or just come soak up inspiration at our offices.<br>
                        Each course at Netcraft Academy has a designated Facebook group for interacting with the other students and instructors. Afterwards, all alumni become part of a larger Netcraft Academy group which operates as a platform for sharing interesting articles, posting job openings, publicizing our events and sharing advice.

                        In line with our vision, Netcraft makes it a priority to give back to the community. One of Netcraft's projects provides complimentary consultation to Box of Dreams, a non-profit organization that makes the dreams of less fortunate children a reality.  We are currently working on a new app for the organization.
                        <br>
                        Netcraft’s contribution helped promote Box of Dreams, which has now fulfilled more than 100 dreams.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, in our constant effort to promote innovation and UX initiatives, we offer complimentary lectures and workshops to groups of startups and entrepreneurs.  This includes three tracks of free monthly conferences for UX designers (UXonBeer), graphic designers (DigitalDesign), and developers (DevShot).
